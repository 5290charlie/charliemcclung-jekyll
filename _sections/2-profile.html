<p>Software Engineer turned DevOps.</p>
<p>Coming from a software engineering background focused in web development, I have always been interested in the supporting infrastructure. With the emergence of DevOps, I have truly found my passion. This newfound enthusiasm has led me to pursue DevOps professionally.</p>
<p>I am currently living in colorful Colorado in the Boulder area. Colorado is an amazing place to be. The weather, the mountains, and the people here make it one of the greatest places to work and live.</p>
<p>I graduated from CU Boulder in 2012 with a BS in Computer Science and I have been working in Boulder ever since. I really enjoyed studying Computer Science in college and hope to one day go to grad school.</p>
<p>I am a generally easy going guy who enjoys spending time with my friends and family. I'm a computer nerd through and through, so I spend a hefty amount of time programming and playing on the computer.</p>
